    <p class="aboutDescription">My interest in software engineering developed when I wanted to create my first crochet website. As I became familiar with the basic skills needed to create a webpage, I found enjoyment in what I was learning. The decision to pursue coding and make it my career was quickly made, and it was not long before I became confident in HTML, CSS and JavaScript. Today, I work as a Software Engineer Apprentice in London, England. I am loving every step of my journey. </p>
    <p class="aboutDescription">When I am away from my computer, I can be found playing my piano and composing original melodies in the afternoon. In the late evening, I am sketching portraits, and stay hibernating in my room as I indludge in crochet over the weekends.</p>
